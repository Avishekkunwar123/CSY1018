Few months back then i was a Muay  thai player.I  would train a lot but when it comes
to running i was a bit lazy and shy cause we have to wear a muyathai shorts in training and
while running.And the funny part those shorts were smaller than usual underware.so whie running we have to go outside
in parks in highway then i couldnt run cause my underware were seen while having those muay tha shorts on
